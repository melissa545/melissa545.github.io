           <h1>About me</h1>
          <p1 class="dumb">Hello, my name is Melissa. I was born in Oakland, California. My dad
          is from Veracruz, Mexico, and my Mom is from Honduras but I forget what part shes
          from. I love Oakland so much but then sometimes I don't because of things that happen.</p1>
         </ul>
         
       <ul>
         <p1>My favorite subject would have to be English and History because its interesting
         learning new things everyday.<br> Also it's interesting to know what happened in our past and
         who our ancestors were. I sometimes draw or paint when im not busy doing my homework, I really
         enjoy it because it keeps me calm.<br> I'm currently practicing for basketball and it really tiring
         and there's lots of hard work to put in. Since I was small ive always wanted to play the piano
         but 3 months ago I got a guitar and im practing on how to play it it's kind of hard but
         ill learn. I guess im a good student. I ended my term with a 3.9.</p1>
